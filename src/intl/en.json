    "aboutMeSection": "<p1>My name is Karol Zieniewicz. Two years ago I found my new passion and I dived into incredible and fascinating world of Front-End technologies. Since then I've been spending most of my free time building my skills with variety of technologies via on-line courses and working on my own projects. My main professional goal now is to find my first job as a Junior Front-End Developer. I see this step as a great opportunity to further improve and gain real-life experience.</p1><p2>When not coding, I'm enjoying my life with my wonderful family - my wife, my little son, a dog and a bunny rabbit. Other than that, I'm a big fan of horror movies and luckily, my wife is, as well. I'm also really interested in home brewing. I find it very relaxing and rewarding.</p2>"
